							<h2>About Me</h2>
							<p></p>Thank you for taking the time to view the site to learn what “Gallowglass Personal Training”
							can offer in the way of fitness, wellness, and wellbeing. So, let me introduce myself. I’m Karl, I’m
							originally from London. I served 15-years in the British Armed forces, as a Marine mountain leader
							specialist, and the Army as a recon team member. I also served as a unit fitness instructor during my
							tenure. I left the military in 2004 and went to University in London, studying counseling, modalities,
							and Majoring in Psychodynamic Counseling. With this training, I was able to help many soldiers come to
							terms with life, in the civilian world, and overcome substance dependence and addiction, mental health
							issues to include PTSD, as well as housing assistance and resettlement for those that were homeless.
							I eventually left England and moved here to the USA. Sadly, shortly after my move, I was diagnosed with
							cancer but have been fortunate to have beaten it. While I was sick, I used the illness as a chance to
							build my strengths! For three-years, I used this illness to hone a powerful sense of purpose and strength
							that allowed me to get back to fitness and what I love to do! With “Gallowglass Personal Training,” I’m
							bringing my personal motto for success to my business. “With great willpower, comes great strength,” is
							a true representation on what I’ve achieved and how great things can manifest in life. Even when there
							are negatives you can bounce them to be a positive force to be used and focused so you can achieve anything!</p>
							
							<h2>My Pledge</h2>
							<p>Unlike physical trainers, you will have the experience of physical, life, and coach training. As a lifestyle
								trainer, the package you will receive is based on a tailored strategy to help you build and achieve your
								personal goals. This includes helping you with a healthy diet by giving you ideas on how a healthy plate
								can give you the strength to train, the correct way, and help you achieve an overall healthy lifestyle.
								Balancing training and diet with lifestyle changes can be quite a challenge to do on your own. As a lifestyle
								personal trainer, I’ll be there to help you with the mental roadblocks and be there to help guide you before
								you go over the edge. With my British Military background in physical training, I teach you how to see the signs
								of negative behavior before they happen or help you stop them before they do too much damage. If you have struggled
								with life issues, diet, self-doubt, mental challenges, or self-esteem issues, then I’m the trainer for you!
								</p>
