								<h2>About Me</h2>
								<p></p>Thank you for taking the time to view the site to learn what “Gallowglass Personal Training”
								can offer in the way of fitness, wellness, and wellbeing. So, let me introduce myself. I’m Karl, I’m
								originally from London. I served 15-years in the British Armed forces, as a Marine mountain leader
								specialist, and the Army as a recon team member. I also served as a unit fitness instructor during my
								tenure. I left the military in 2004 and went to University in London, studying counseling, modalities,
								and Majoring in Psychodynamic Counseling. With this training, I was able to help many soldiers come to
								terms with life, in the civilian world, and overcome substance dependence and addiction, mental health
								issues to include PTSD, as well as housing assistance and resettlement for those that were homeless.
								I eventually left England and moved here to the USA. Sadly, shortly after my move, I was diagnosed with
								cancer but have been fortunate to have beaten it. While I was sick, I used the illness as a chance to
								build my strengths! For three-years, I used this illness to hone a powerful sense of purpose and strength
								that allowed me to get back to fitness and what I love to do! With “Gallowglass Personal Training,” I’m
								bringing my personal motto for success to my business. “With great willpower, comes great strength,” is
								a true representation on what I’ve achieved and how great things can manifest in life. Even when there
								are negatives you can bounce them to be a positive force to be used and focused so you can achieve anything!</p>
								
								<h2>My Pledge</h2>
								<p>Unlike physical trainers, you will have the experience of physical, life, and coach training. As a lifestyle
									trainer, the package you will receive is based on a tailored strategy to help you build and achieve your
									personal goals. This includes helping you with a healthy diet by giving you ideas on how a healthy plate
									can give you the strength to train, the correct way, and help you achieve an overall healthy lifestyle.
									Balancing training and diet with lifestyle changes can be quite a challenge to do on your own. As a lifestyle
									personal trainer, I’ll be there to help you with the mental roadblocks and be there to help guide you before
									you go over the edge. With my British Military background in physical training, I teach you how to see the signs
									of negative behavior before they happen or help you stop them before they do too much damage. If you have struggled
									with life issues, diet, self-doubt, mental challenges, or self-esteem issues, then I’m the trainer for you!

								<h2>Weight Training</h2>
								<p>As your personal trainer, I will provide you with individualized instruction based on your current fitness
								level. I will educate and study you by assessing what your body can and cannot do and will design a workout
								regimen accordingly. During the workout, as your trainer, I will monitor your progress and add intensity or
								slow things down a bit if needed. The end result is a workout tailored to your body and fitness goals. I will
								keep a record of your progress and monitor you on a regular basis. Regular weight training sessions under guidance
								by myself, are the best way to keep tabs on the effectiveness of your program. If your progress stalls, we can look 
								at adding new, targeted exercises to get off the plateau. Your training will become more specialized as you build strength and stamina.</p>

								<h2>Boxfit</h2>
								<p>Boxing is a great way to develop both functional and aesthetic abs. A big misconception is that
								boxing is merely an arms workout. Sure, if you box with poor form your shoulders will burn like no
								other but when you box with proper form it is also a profound core workout. With all techniques and
								interval training, Box-fit will give you an overall conditioned body as well as the release of stress. </p>
